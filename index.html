                    Welcome to our website! Here you will find a collection of data visualizations 
                    related to significant global events. Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive 
                    overview of these events, allowing you to explore and understand the data in a meaningful way.

                <p class="text">
                    We are going to begin our exploration of the dataset by creating an interactive visualization. This visualization 
                    will feature a 3D globe of the Earth, designed to enhance your user experience by allowing for dynamic interaction 
                    with the data. You will have the ability to select between different viewing modes: one where event markers are 
                    displayed on the globe, color-coded according to their impact, and another that shows a heat map representing the 
                    temporal and geographical distribution of events worldwide.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In the first mode, each marker's color will reflect the magnitude of the event's impact, providing a quick visual 
                    assessment of severity. You can hover your mouse over any marker to receive a popup with more detailed information 
                    about that particular event, including its nature, consequences, and any significant data points related to the event.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Alternatively, the heat map mode offers a time-lapse feature, allowing you to observe how the frequency and location 
                    of events have evolved over time. This mode aims to provide a clearer understanding of trends and patterns, helping 
                    identify hotspots of activity or shifts in the occurrence of events globally.

                    We are a team of students currently enrolled in COM-480 Data Visualization at EPFL, undertaking 
                    the task of creating a website dedicated to significant global events. At its current stage, this 
                    website serves as the skeletal framework for our upcoming project.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Utilizing the FullPage.js library, our objective is to develop a single-page platform with distinct sections, 
                    providing users with a structured navigation experience. Through this framework, we aim to offer a streamlined 
                    interface for accessing a variety of content.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In addition to structural considerations, we are focused on implementing various visualization techniques to enhance 
                    the user's ability to interact with and understand the data. Our approach encompasses a range of visualization methods, 
                    from simple charts to more complex graphics, in order to present the data in a clear and informative manner.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Our efforts are geared towards creating a functional and informative resource for exploring global events. 
                    We invite you to follow along as we refine and expand upon this initial framework, with the goal of delivering a 
                    valuable tool for understanding the world around us.
