                    Welcome to our website! Here you will find a collection of data visualizations 
                    related to significant global events. Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive 
                    overview of these events, allowing you to explore and understand the data in a meaningful way.

                <h1 class="title">GLOBAL EVENT</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    We are going to begin our exploration of the dataset with an interactive visualization on a 3D globe. This visualization 
                    features a 3D globe of the Earth, designed to enhance your user experience by allowing for dynamic interaction 
                    with the data. You have the ability to select between different viewing modes: one where event markers are 
                    displayed on the globe, color-coded according to their impact, and another that shows a heat map representing the 
                    geographical distribution of events worldwide in our dataset.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In the first mode, each marker's color reflect the magnitude of the event's impact, providing a quick visual 
                    assessment of severity. You can click on any marker to receive more detailed information 
                    about that particular event, including its nature, consequences, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Alternatively, the heat map mode allows you to observe how the frequency and location 
                    of events are distributed around the globe. You can hover your mouse on any county to get the name of the country and the 
                    number of event we have in our dataset for this country. 
                    This mode aims to provide a clearer understanding of trends and patterns, helping 
                    identify hotspots of activity or shifts in the occurrence of events globally.

                    We are a team of students currently enrolled in COM-480 Data Visualization at EPFL, undertaking 
                    the task of creating a website dedicated to significant global events. At its current stage, this 
                    website serves as the skeletal framework for our upcoming project.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Utilizing the FullPage.js library, our objective is to develop a single-page platform with distinct sections, 
                    providing users with a structured navigation experience. Through this framework, we aim to offer a streamlined 
                    interface for accessing a variety of content.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In addition to structural considerations, we are focused on implementing various visualization techniques to enhance 
                    the user's ability to interact with and understand the data. Our approach encompasses a range of visualization methods, 
                    from simple charts to more complex graphics, in order to present the data in a clear and informative manner.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Our efforts are geared towards creating a functional and informative resource for exploring global events. 
                    We invite you to follow along as we refine and expand upon this initial framework, with the goal of delivering a 
                    valuable tool for understanding the world around us.
