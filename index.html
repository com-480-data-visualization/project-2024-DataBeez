                    We are a team of students currently enrolled in COM-480 Data Visualization at EPFL, undertaking 
                    the task of creating a website dedicated to significant global events. At its current stage, this 
                    website serves as the skeletal framework for our upcoming project.

                <p class="text">
                    Utilizing the FullPage.js library, our objective is to develop a single-page platform with distinct sections, 
                    providing users with a structured navigation experience. Through this framework, we aim to offer a streamlined 
                    interface for accessing a variety of content.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In addition to structural considerations, we are focused on implementing various visualization techniques to enhance 
                    the user's ability to interact with and understand the data. Our approach encompasses a range of visualization methods, 
                    from simple charts to more complex graphics, in order to present the data in a clear and informative manner.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Our efforts are geared towards creating a functional and informative resource for exploring global events. 
                    We invite you to follow along as we refine and expand upon this initial framework, with the goal of delivering a 
                    valuable tool for understanding the world around us.
